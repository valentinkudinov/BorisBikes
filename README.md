# BorisBikes(Santander Bicycle Docking stations)

Transport for London, responsible for delivery of a new bike system, came with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
